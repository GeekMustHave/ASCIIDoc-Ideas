=== VSCode ASCIIDoctor Snippet library

Over the past couple of years I have had multiple snippet libraries for ASCIIDoctor.
Recently I decided to make one central snippet library based on the documentation process I Use.

A copy of the snippet library is at {docodir}/asciidoc.json link:{docodir}/asciidoc.json[ASCIIDoc VSCode Snippets, window='_blank']
